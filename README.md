All the codes are written in [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org/), free and open-source software for Engineers & Scientists. Available under the [GPL License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html). Scilab includes hundreds of mathematical functions. It has a high-level programming language allowing access to advanced data structures, 2-D and 3-D graphical functions.

A large number of functionalities is included in Scilab: control, simulation, optimization, signal processing..., and Xcos, the hybrid dynamic systems modeler and simulator is provided with the platform. Scilab is used in all major strategic scientific areas of industry and services such as space, aeronautics, automotive, energy, defense, finance and transport. I hope this repository will help you.
